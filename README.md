# Description

This project is a front-end for the YuGames API, done using Angular 17 / Tailwind CSS, and will be running live on [this site](https://yugames.valentinvirot.fr/).

Currently, this front-end uses multiple concepts, such as :

- Dependency Injection
- Multiple layout
- Advanced routing
- Login with Keycloak
- State Management (NgRx, ...)
- Administration portal (with different layout)
- Lazy loading
- ...

Data is directly coming from the [YuGames API](https://yugames-api.valentinvirot.fr/swagger).

## How to run it?

Just type `npm ci` to get all dependencies, and then use `ng serve` to run it locally.
You can also use my Dockerfile to use it (it exposes the 80 port).

## Can I use it for my own?

If this repo is public, you can clone/fork my project and use it for your own website. Just credit me somewhere in your site, as a thanks for my work :)

You can contact me using my [Portfolio](https://www.valentinvirot.fr), if you have some question about it. Have fun!
